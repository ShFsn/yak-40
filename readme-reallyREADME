Flying:
- Flaps full, T/O thrust full
- Rotate at around 190km/h, keep a (really!) low pitch until you reach above 200km/h, raise flaps and let go 

- Autopilot AP-40:
  - Put up both switches on AP-remote (middle console); left one is "Power ON", right one is "Pitch Channel"
  - Press middle button or Shift+y to engage AP (Shift+y toggles engage/disengage)
    - At first init, AP will level wings and hold current pitch
  - Press right button to engage Altitude Hold
  - As long as "y" is depressed, "Combined Control" is engaged -> AP servos will be disconnected and plane can be manually controlled
    - When "y" is released, AP will level wings and hold current pitch
  - Ctrl-c lets you see the clickspots of the autopilot-"joystick" with which you can control pitch and roll
